# VR-programming-system
The current programming system for VR design usually are text-based system, requiring great knowledge of computer science for the programmer, which is hard for the novice, children or artist. In this project, we will design and implement a programming system VWord, which is easy to construct 3D spatial world and programming by virtual blocks with immersive experience. VWord aims to support userâ€™s creativity, spatial skills and computational thinking skills.
