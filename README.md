One-paragraph description

VWord is a coding game for children in VR environment. There are two parts of this game: create and program. In the create part, children can use the map elements (island, tree, chick, etc) to create their own map. In the programming part, children will have a programming panel on their left hand with program blocks on it, and they can grab and put these blocks in 3d space to create programs and run it.


Instructions for running the project
* Create part:
   * Grab the rock/ tree/ chicken from the white table and put it on the blue table and create your own world around you (world in miniature).
   * Use your right hand finger tip to choose the island on the blue table (press the hand trigger and release the index trigger, the finger need to collide with the selected object), selected object will have a white light transparent effect around it.
